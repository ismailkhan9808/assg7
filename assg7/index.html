    <h2>How To Make Your Resume Comprehensive (With Examples)</h2>
<p>1. Choose the right format
A format is the style and order in which you display information on your resume. You can choose from three commonly used resume formats depending on which is right for you—chronological (or reverse-chronological), functional or a combination.
Chronological—A chronological resume puts the professional history section first and is a good option if you have a rich professional work history with no gaps in employment.</p>
<p>Functional—The functional resume format emphasizes the skills section and is a good option if you are switching careers or have gaps in your work history.</p>
<p>Combination—The combination resume format is a good option if you have some professional experience because it emphasizes both skills and work history equally.
</p>
<h3>2. Include your name and contact information</h3>
<p>Your resume should begin with your name and contact information, including your professional email address and phone number. You have a choice about whether or not to include your mailing address. Your name should be highly visible at the top of your resume with a bolder or larger font than the rest of the document but no more than a 14-point size. You might also include a link to your online portfolio if your profession warrants it.</p>
<h3>3. Tailor your resume for each position</h3>
<p>Revising your resume to tailor it to each position you apply for is important. For each job, adjust the keywords in the skills section so that they are a great fit for what the employer needs. Be sure you change what's emphasized in the professional history and educational experiences sections to mirror what’s listed in the job description.</p>
<h3>4. Add a resume summary or objective</h3>
<p>After your contact information, you can include either a resume summary or an objective statement. An objective statement quickly explains your career goals and is a good choice for those with limited professional experience, such as recent college or high school graduates. A resume summary is a short statement that uses active language to describe your relevant work experience, skills and accomplishments.</p>
<h3>5. List your soft and hard skills</h3>
<p>Take a moment to consider which skills make you a great fit for the job. Review the job description and highlight keywords that you have had proven success with in the past. Consider both hard (technical) and soft (interpersonal) skills, as well as transferable skills you can use when changing careers or industries. Create a skills section with the keywords that are relevant to the employer. List any required skills like certifications or licenses first. Since it's paired with the job description, this section needs to be customized for each job application.</p>
<h3>6. Detail your professional history</h3>
<p>Write your professional history section in reverse-chronological order. Start with your most recent job and provide a short description, including the company name, month and year you started and left, your job title and a few key achievements during your time at the company. You might also include your relevant accomplishments or achievements during each job.
When listing your professional history, keep a few best practices in mind:
Use numbers to measure your impact when possible. Quantify your achievements whenever possible by including specific results to help employers understand your potential value to their company.
Example: “Developed new process for requesting supplies, reducing fulfillment time by 10%.”
Use keywords from the job description. As in the skills section, include keywords from the job description in your history section. For example, if the job description mentions the importance of meeting sales quotas, you could include information about how you’ve met or exceeded quotas in past roles.
Example: “Achieved goal of reaching 250% annual sales quota, winning sales MVP two quarters in a row.”
Be brief. Employers have mere seconds to review your resume, so keep your descriptions as concise and relevant as possible. Try removing filler words like “and” and “the.” Only list details or duties tied to key achievements instead of multiple lines describing your role.
Use action verbs. Make a stronger impact by using action verbs to describe your professional achievements. Some examples include “developed,” “saved,” “drove” and “managed.”
Follow the same process for other work experiences. If you do not have an extensive professional history, include internships and volunteer opportunities following the same format.</p>
